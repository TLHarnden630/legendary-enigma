# tools

This folder contains helper CLIs for the repository.

- `agent-cli` — a minimal Node-based CLI that mirrors the original PowerShell helper.
- `agen` — a minimal Go-based single-binary CLI scaffold.

These are small placeholder implementations to get the `tools/` path tracked in git. They can be expanded later.
